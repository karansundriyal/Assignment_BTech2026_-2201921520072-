Explanation:
1. Class Solution
The Solution class has a method called validPalindrome, which checks if a string can become a palindrome after deleting at most one character.
If a mismatch is found during the comparison of characters from both ends (s[left] != s[right]), the method canBePalindromeAfterDeletion is called to check if skipping one character (either left or right) will make the string a palindrome.
The helper method isPalindrome is used to check if a substring (from left to right) is a palindrome.

2. Method validPalindrome:
This method compares characters from both ends (left and right). If characters at these positions are the same, it moves inward (left++ and right--).
If a mismatch is found, it checks whether removing one character (either the character at left or right) will result in a palindrome.

3. Method canBePalindromeAfterDeletion:
This method checks if we can remove either the character at left or right to form a palindrome. It does this by calling the isPalindrome method twice: once after skipping the character at left, and once after skipping the character at right.

4. Helper Method isPalindrome:
This method checks if a substring (from left to right indices) is a palindrome by iterating through the substring and comparing characters at each end.

5. Main Function:
The main function creates an object of class Solution and calls the validPalindrome method to check if the string can become a palindrome after deleting at most one character.
The result is printed based on the return value of the validPalindrome method.
